An exercise in using APIs

This was created using:
  `express AmazonLexTrial --no-view`

Run it like this:
  `npm start`
or
  `DEBUG=AmazonlexTutorial:* npm start`
it also runs with `node app.js` and `yarn start` (the latter because of the start script in package.json).

The app appears in `localhost:9090`
